# StreamCIFAR: Interactive Image Classification Web App with Streamlit

StreamCIFAR is an interactive web application built with Streamlit that allows users to classify images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. With StreamCIFAR, users can upload images or choose from a predefined set to see real-time predictions from the pre-trained model. Additionally, the app provides options to adjust model hyperparameters for experimentation and fine-tuning.

## Features

- **Upload Images:** Users can upload their own images to classify or choose from a set of predefined images.
- **Real-Time Predictions:** StreamCIFAR provides real-time predictions for uploaded images using a pre-trained CNN model.
- **Adjustable Hyperparameters:** Users can tweak model hyperparameters directly from the web interface to experiment with different architectures and improve model performance.
- **Intuitive Interface:** The web app features an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it accessible to both beginners and experts in computer vision.
